VERSION HISTORY

---

2.0beta1: ?????

01. Complete rewrite of CSS files - simplified many rules, using Normalize and Formalize
    as a baseline for reset.css. Also should be more forgiving of plugin code now.

02.  Now uses Sass (http://sass-lang.com) for speedier development/reduced code.

03. More responsive - extensive work on making the admin area more usable on a small
    screen devices.

04. Nicer aesthetic. Just one colour scheme now - but colours can be easily changed using
    Sass variables.

05. SVG (resolution independent) images for supported browsers (via Modernizr).

06. New lightweight navigation bar.

07. Touch friendly (via Modernizr). Removed unviable dropdown navigation menu on touch
    devices and instead using a <select> tag.

08. The monospace Cousine font is now bundled, which provides a more consistent font
   across multiple devices.

09. Add CSS gradient and transition support for IE10. Add CSS gradient support for
    IE6-IE9 (via MS filter). Add CSS gradient support for Opera 11.10.

10. Remove custom (hot pink) selection colour, it's better for accessibility to let user 
    keep their own browser selection colour settings.

11.

1.2.3: 24/06/2011

01. The !important class on textareas to override inline styling on glz_custom_field
    elements was stopping users from manually resizing any of their textareas within the
    theme (in browsers that support resizing). A better compromise has been devised now.

01. Change to more standard version labelling and use Textgarden.org download link.

02. The dropdown menu code has been rewritten to be more usable on touchscreen devices

---
