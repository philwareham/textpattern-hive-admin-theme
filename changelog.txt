VERSION HISTORY

---

1.3: TBC

1. Initial work to make theme passable on small screen sizes (such as an iPhone).
   This works by generally hiding features that would not render well on that size
   screen (such as lists) - a kind of admin area 'lite' version if you will. More work
   to improve this will follow in future releases.

2. Now uses Cousine font from Google Font API for monospaced text. Solves font
   inconsistencies across multiple devices.

3. Remove custom (hot pink) selection colour, it's better for accessibility to let user 
   keep their own browser selection colour settings.
   
4. For better accessibility, allow zoom on touch devices.

5. Had to revert back to making the top navigation not links again, as it was reported
   that Android devices were firing off the link immediately instead of focussing on
   the dropdown. Bah!

6. Add CSS gradient and transition support for IE10. Add CSS gradient support for
   IE6-IE9 (via MS filter). Add CSS gradient support for Opera 11.10.

7. More rendering fixups for various browsers as recommended in Normalize CSS.

8.

1.2.3: 24/06/2011

1. The !important class on textareas to override inline styling on glz_custom_field
   elements was stopping users from manually resizing any of their textareas within the
   theme (in browsers that support resizing). A better compromise has been devised now.

---

1.2.2: 22/06/2011

1. Change to more standard version labelling and use Textgarden.org download link.

2. The dropdown menu code has been rewritten to be more usable on touchscreen devices
   without compromising the desktop version. For example you can now close active
   dropdown menus on touchscreen devices nicely, and top navigation buttons are now
   links again like they were in v1.1.

3. Tidy up of code in 'hive.php' to make editing/customising easier.

4. Added styling for the tru_tags plugin in 'custom.css', thanks to Stuart Butcher.

5. Form preview button is now removed and other fields on the form page inlined to
   save some screen estate, thanks to Stuart Butcher.

6. CSS cleanup: make 'outline:none' now 'outline:0' and 'border:none' now 'border:0'.

7. Amend language uploader area CSS, as structure changed slightly in TXP v4.4.1.

8. Fixed a major display bug when using both glz_custom_fields and bot_wtc plugins.

9. Style up the wet_quicklink plugin text 'Insert Link' as a button.

3. Added responsive CSS for detecting 768px portait screen orientation and adjust page
   width accordingly.

   CSS files (otherwise it could override colourscheme rules).

---

1.1: 12/06/2011

1. You can now choose between 3 different colourschemes: default, green and blue.

1.01: 08/06/2011
